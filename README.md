## Objectives of the Enhancements

The primary objectives of this web application are:

- To implement robust security protocols to safeguard the web application from common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL Injection
- To strengthen the authentication and authorization mechanisms so only authorized users have access to sensitive data and functionalities like profile and booking features.
- To define and enforce user roles and permissions to restrict access based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring users can only access resources necessary for their role.
- To enforce strong password policies, including complexity requirements, regular password changes, and secure storage practices such as hashing and salting.

## Web Application Security Enhancements

To ensure the security of our web application, we have considered the following for enhancements of this web application:

1. **HTTPS Usage**: All communication between the client and the server is encrypted using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

2. **Input Validation**: Proper input validation is implemented across the application to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**: Robust authentication mechanisms are in place to verify user identities, and strict authorization rules are enforced to control access to sensitive resources.

4. **Session Management**: Secure session management techniques are used to protect session data from tampering and session hijacking.

5. **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information are encrypted both in transit and at rest to maintain confidentiality.

6. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention**: Output encoding is applied to user-supplied data to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
   
7. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Use anti-CSRF tokens to ensure that requests made on behalf of authenticated users are valid and not initiated by malicious sites.
   
8. **Database Security Principles**: Employ parameterized queries and prepared statements to prevent malicious SQL code from being executed in the database.

9.  **Security Headers**: HTTP security headers are properly configured to enhance overall security posture.

Thus, we have implemented a comprehensive set of security measures to protect user data and ensure a secure browsing experience. Below is a detailed description of the security enhancements integrated into the application:

1. **ID Random Generation in User Table**:

6. **Account Lockout After Three Failed Attempts**:
   - To prevent brute force attacks, user accounts are temporarily locked after three consecutive failed login attempts.
   - As shown in `login.php`
```php
// Check if account is currently locked out
if (isset($_SESSION['lockout_time']) && $_SESSION['lockout_time'] > time()) {
    $seconds_remaining = $_SESSION['lockout_time'] - time();
    $error = "Account locked. Please try again in {$seconds_remaining} seconds.";
    $_SESSION['login_attempts'] = 0;
}

// Increment login attempts
$_SESSION['login_attempts']++;

// Check if login attempts exceed threshold
if ($_SESSION['login_attempts'] >= 3) {
    handle_lockout();
    $error = "Too many failed attempts. Account locked. Please try again in 10 seconds.";
}
```


7. **Encrypted Password During Submission**:

10. **Authorization on Every Request**:
    - Authorization checks are performed on every request to ensure users only access resources and functionalities they are permitted to use.

11. **Authentication**:
    - Robust authentication mechanisms are in place to verify user identities before granting access to restricted areas of the application.
    - Using `login_status.php` to ensure that only `isloggedin=true` has access to do everything
      ``` php
      session_start();
      $response = array('isLoggedIn' => false, 'role' => '');
      if (isset($_SESSION['logged_in']) && $_SESSION['logged_in']) {
          // User is logged in
          $response['isLoggedIn'] = true;
          $response['role'] = $_SESSION['role']; // Retrieve and set the role
      } else {
          // User is not logged in
          $response['isLoggedIn'] = false;
          $response['role'] = 'guest'; // Set role to 'guest' for non-logged in users
      }
      echo json_encode($response);
      ?>
      ```
      **Usage in `scripts.js`** <br>

        function hashPassword(event) {
            event.preventDefault();
            const passwordField = document.getElementById('password');
            const hashedPasswordField = document.getElementById('hashed_password');

            // Hash the password using SHA-256
            const hashedPassword = CryptoJS.SHA256(passwordField.value).toString();
            
            // Set the hashed password to the hidden field
            hashedPasswordField.value = hashedPassword;
            
            // Clear the plain text password field
            passwordField.value = '';
            
            // Submit the form
            document.getElementById('loginForm').submit();

      $phone = sanitize_input($_POST['phone']);
      ```
13. **CSRF Token Implementation**:
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens are used to protect against CSRF attacks by ensuring that requests are legitimate and originate from authenticated users.
      

14. **Manipulation in Booking System**:
    - Measures are taken to prevent unauthorized manipulation of the booking system, ensuring the integrity of bookings and related transactions.

15. **Same-Origin Policy**:
    - The same-origin policy is enforced to prevent unauthorized scripts on other sites from accessing data on my application.
      ```php
      // Validate Referer Header
         if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])) {
             $referer = parse_url($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], PHP_URL_HOST);
             $allowed_domains = ['final.com']; 
         
             if (!in_array($referer, $allowed_domains)) {
                 header('HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden');
                 die('Access Denied');
             }
         } else {
             header('HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden');
             die('Access Denied');
         }
      ```
16. **HttpOnly Cookies**:
    - Cookies are set in the `https.conf` with the HttpOnly attribute to prevent client-side scripts from accessing them, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.
