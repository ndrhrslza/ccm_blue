## Objectives of the Enhancements

The primary objectives of this web application are:

- To implement robust security protocols to safeguard the web application from common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL Injection
- To strengthen the authentication and authorization mechanisms so only authorized users have access to sensitive data and functionalities like profile and booking features.
- To define and enforce user roles and permissions to restrict access based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring users can only access resources necessary for their role.
- To enforce strong password policies, including complexity requirements, regular password changes, and secure storage practices such as hashing and salting.

## Web Application Security Enhancements

To ensure the security of our web application, we have considered the following for enhancements of this web application:

1. **HTTPS Usage**: All communication between the client and the server is encrypted using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

2. **Input Validation**: Proper input validation is implemented across the application to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**: Robust authentication mechanisms are in place to verify user identities, and strict authorization rules are enforced to control access to sensitive resources.

4. **Session Management**: Secure session management techniques are used to protect session data from tampering and session hijacking.

5. **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information are encrypted both in transit and at rest to maintain confidentiality.

6. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention**: Output encoding is applied to user-supplied data to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
   
7. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Use anti-CSRF tokens to ensure that requests made on behalf of authenticated users are valid and not initiated by malicious sites.
   
8. **Database Security Principles**: Employ parameterized queries and prepared statements to prevent malicious SQL code from being executed in the database.

9.  **Security Headers**: HTTP security headers are properly configured to enhance overall security posture.

Thus, we have implemented a comprehensive set of security measures to protect user data and ensure a secure browsing experience. Below is a detailed description of the security enhancements integrated into the application:

1. **ID Random Generation in User Table**:
   - Each user is assigned a unique, randomly generated ID upon registration to mitigate risks associated with predictable user IDs.
     <br>**UUID() in `form.php`** <br>

2. **Encoding**:
   - Encoding is used to ensure data is securely transmitted and displayed, preventing injection attacks and XSS vulnerabilities by encoding output data.<br>
     **Encoding in `form.php`** <br>

3. **Comparison Login with Hashed Password**:
   - User login credentials are verified by comparing the entered password with the stored hashed password, ensuring secure authentication processes.<br>
    **Comparison in `login.php`** <br>

5. **SSL Certificate for Localhost (Secure HTTPS Connection)**:
   - An SSL certificate is essential for creating a secure HTTPS connection on localhost. It encrypts data transmitted between the server and client, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.<br>
     <br>**Cert files in the local machine** <br>

6. **Account Lockout After Three Failed Attempts**:
   - To prevent brute force attacks, user accounts are temporarily locked after three consecutive failed login attempts.
   - As shown in `login.php`
```php
// Check if account is currently locked out
if (isset($_SESSION['lockout_time']) && $_SESSION['lockout_time'] > time()) {
    $seconds_remaining = $_SESSION['lockout_time'] - time();
    $error = "Account locked. Please try again in {$seconds_remaining} seconds.";
    $_SESSION['login_attempts'] = 0;
}

// Increment login attempts
$_SESSION['login_attempts']++;

// Check if login attempts exceed threshold
if ($_SESSION['login_attempts'] >= 3) {
    handle_lockout();
    $error = "Too many failed attempts. Account locked. Please try again in 10 seconds.";
}
```


7. **Encrypted Password During Submission**:
   - Passwords are encrypted during form submission to prevent interception by malicious actors during transmission.

10. **Authorization on Every Request**:
    - Authorization checks are performed on every request to ensure users only access resources and functionalities they are permitted to use.

11. **Authentication**:
    - Robust authentication mechanisms are in place to verify user identities before granting access to restricted areas of the application.

12. **Hashing, Salting, and Sanitizing Input**:
    - User inputs are hashed and salted to enhance password security, and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

13. **CSRF Token Implementation**:
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens are used to protect against CSRF attacks by ensuring that requests are legitimate and originate from authenticated users.

14. **Manipulation in Booking System**:
    - Measures are taken to prevent unauthorized manipulation of the booking system, ensuring the integrity of bookings and related transactions.

15. **Same-Origin Policy**:
    - The same-origin policy is enforced to prevent unauthorized scripts on other sites from accessing data on my application.

16. **HttpOnly Cookies**:
    - Cookies are set with the HttpOnly attribute to prevent client-side scripts from accessing them, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.

17. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
    - A CSP is implemented to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, reducing the risk of XSS and data injection attacks.

18. **Idle Timeout**:
    - Sessions are configured to expire after a period of inactivity to reduce the risk of unauthorized access from unattended sessions.

19. **Hide Indexes**:
    - Directory listings are disabled to prevent attackers from viewing the structure of directories and files on the server.

20. **Hide Detailed Errors**:
    - Detailed error messages are hidden from users to prevent leaking information about the application's structure or vulnerabilities.

These security measures collectively enhance the robustness and resilience of the web application, safeguarding user data and maintaining a secure environment for users to interact with the system.
